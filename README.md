Hereâ€™s a clean, generic README template for your **MethylPipe** package, including installation instructions and usage examples. You can customize it later with more details about functions, workflows, and plots.

# MethylPipe

**MethylPipe** is an R package for downstream processing and analysis of cfRRBS (cell-free Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) data. It provides functions for:

- Loading and filtering coverage data
- Sample and site quality control
- Aggregating methylation data to regions
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP, t-SNE)
- Batch effect detection and correction
- Generating publication-ready plots

---

## Installation

### From CRAN (future, if published)
```R
install.packages("MethylPipe")
````

### From GitHub (current)

You will need the `remotes` package:

```R
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Lucmeister55/MethylPipe", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Dependencies

MethylPipe relies on several R packages:

* `methylKit`
* `ggplot2`
* `dplyr`
* `limma`
* `ggrepel`
* `forcats`
* `MASS`
* `impute`

Make sure these are installed; `install_github(..., dependencies = TRUE)` should handle most of them automatically.

## Quick Start

```R
library(MethylPipe)

# Example: prepare methylation matrix
meth_matrix <- prepare_methylation_matrix(meth_obj, feature_name = "CpG_sites")

# Generate QC plots
plot_methylStats(meth_obj, plot_dir = "plots", prefix = "SampleQC")

# Explore PCA and detect outliers
results <- count_exploration_wrapper(meth_united, "CpG_sites", meta, plot_path = "plots/PCA")
```

---

## Documentation

Full documentation for each function is available in R:

```R
?prepare_methylation_matrix
?plot_methylStats
?count_exploration_wrapper
```
